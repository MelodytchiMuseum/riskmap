# Risk Map
Made as part of the class project in my Spring 2014 CSci class. In this class, we all worked together to create an online-multiplayer version of the Risk board game. I was tasked with handling the map and, subsequently, map creation.

Everything in the RiskMap folder was programmed by me. The RiskMap folder contains the code for the map creation program. After creating the program, I used it to create a couple maps for my fellow students to use for playing. Looking back on it, the program is not all too efficient or user-friendly. However, I was the only one using it.

RiskMap relies on the entire SURiskLibrary folder. As its name implies, the folder is a library that contains vital classes utilized not only by RiskMap but by the other students' applications as well. I did not remove other students' contributions from that folder, as I feared it would interfere with functionality (as I had not touched this program in 3 years, so I largely forgot how it worked).

---

Though my memory is not as clear regarding this project, I will try to pinpoint my contributions within SURiskLibrary.
* Continent.cs was programmed entirely by me.
* Map.cs was mostly programmed by me; the addContinent, addTerritory, and getTerritory functions may have not been programmed by me. Why this may be the case, I honestly do not remember.
* ReinforcementCard.cs may was programmed entirely by me.
* Territory.cs was programmed entirely by me. I do not remember why exactly the addNeighbor function's comment is "out of style", but I do remember programming it.
